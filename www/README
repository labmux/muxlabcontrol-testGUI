Virtualizing the 811 [works!]

Creating an 811 image

The image used to flash 811s in production will not work for our purposed. Create your own image by booting the 811 you’d like to virtualize. Then, from a different computer, run this command:

ssh root@192.168.168.50 "dd if=/dev/mmcblk0 | gzip -1 -" | dd of=mnc811.gz

Creating the virtual box harddrive

The resulting file is a gzipped image (should be around 2GB, decompressed 30G, make sure you have space for this).
On the host machine, decompress this file. For convenience, rename the resulting file to include an extension, say .img.
Then (install virtualbox) and run this command:
VBoxManage convertfromraw -format VDI mnc.img mncVDI.vdi

Then, open virtual box using
sudo virtualbox

Then,
Create a new box (64-bit) using the new VDI file (“Use an existing virtual hard drive file”)
Give it at least 2GB or RAM (4GB used in test)
System > Enable EFI (special OSes only)
That’s it!
