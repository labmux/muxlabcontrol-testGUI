- anyone can boot up any version of 811 and test with it, boots in < 1 second
- 811 will be accessible on the network with its own ip address so you can test more involved situations

- uses cutting edge technology such as selenium
- reliable tests which use a clean app installation and a clean 811 installation for each test run
